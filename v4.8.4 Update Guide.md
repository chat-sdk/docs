# v4.8.4 Update Guide

In this version, we have changed the Chat SDK initialization code. 

We have removed the need to pass a context object to the `Configuration.Builder` object: 

```
Configuration.Builder config = new Configuration.Builder();
```

We have updated the `ChatSDK.initialize` function to take a `Context`, `Configuration` and then two classes for the `NetworkAdapter` and `InterfaceAdapter`:

```
ChatSDK.initialize(context, config.build(), FirebaseNetworkAdapter.class, BaseInterfaceAdapter.class);
```

You will also need to change the `catch` block as follows:

```
catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

The configuration object has also been updated:

If you were using a configuration method that started with `set` like `setDefaultUserAvatarURL(...)` this has beeen updated to `defaultUserAvatarURL(...)` for consistency

## New Features

We have added some new confguration options:

```
public String firebaseDatabaseUrl;
public String firebaseStorageUrl;
public String firebaseApp;
public String firebaseFunctionsRegion;
```

These can be used to specify the Firebase app which is used by the Chat SDK.
