#v4.8.4 Update Guide

In this version, we have changed the Chat SDK initialization code. 

We have removed the need to pass a context object to the `Configuration.Builder` object: 

```
Configuration.Builder config = new Configuration.Builder();
```

We have updated the `ChatSDK.initialize` function to take a `Context`, `Configuration` and then two classes for the `NetworkAdapter` and `InterfaceAdapter`:

```
ChatSDK.initialize(context, config.build(), FirebaseNetworkAdapter.class, BaseInterfaceAdapter.class);
```

You will also need to change the `catch` block as follows:

```
catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
